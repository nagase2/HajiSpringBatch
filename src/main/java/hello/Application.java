 * @SpringBootApplication is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

 *  @EnableAutoConfiguration tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings,
 *  other beans, and various property settings. Normally you would add @EnableWebMvc for a Spring MVC
 *  app, but Spring Boot adds it automatically when it sees spring-webmvc on the classpath. This
 *  flags the application as a web application and activates key behaviors such as setting up a
 *  DispatcherServlet.
 * 
 *  @ComponentScan tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the
 *  hello package, allowing it to find the HelloController.
